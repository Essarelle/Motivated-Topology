# Motivated Topology

Introductory notes on point-set topology, with some neat visualization tricks.

You can read the notes [here](https://github.com/colah/Motivated-Topology/raw/pdf-release/topology.pdf).

# Instructions to build the PDF

Install [pdflatex](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html), [ghostview](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gv/index.htm) and [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/).

Then, cd to the root of this repository and type `make`. That will compile the images, and then the whole `topology.pdf` document.

To clean out the files that make generates, just type `make clean`.
